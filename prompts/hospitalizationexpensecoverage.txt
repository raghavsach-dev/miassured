      - List all expenses explicitly not covered
      - Detail all conditions that must be satisfied for coverage
      - Note any sub-limits or restrictions on in-patient care coverage

   b) PRE-HOSPITALIZATION EXPENSES
      - Document the coverage amount or percentage
      - Identify the time period covered before hospitalization (e.g., 30/60/90 days)
      - List all expenses specifically covered for pre-hospitalization
      - List all expenses explicitly not covered
      - Detail all conditions that must be satisfied for coverage
      - Note any documentation requirements specific to pre-hospitalization claims

   c) POST-HOSPITALIZATION EXPENSES

      - Note any documentation requirements specific to post-hospitalization claims

   d) ROOM RENT/CATEGORY ELIGIBILITY
      - Document the exact room rent limits or categories covered
      - Identify if limits are fixed amounts or percentages of sum insured
      - Detail any impact on other claim components if room rent exceeds eligible limits
      - List any variant-specific differences in room rent eligibility
      - Note any conditions or exceptions to room rent restrictions

   e) ICU RENT CAPPING
      - Document the exact ICU rent limits
      - Identify if limits are fixed amounts or percentages of sum insured
      - Detail any impact on other claim components if ICU rent exceeds eligible limits
      - List any variant-specific differences in ICU rent eligibility
      - Note any conditions or exceptions to ICU rent restrictions

   f) MANDATORY CO-PAYMENT
      - Document the co-payment percentage required
      - Identify if co-payment varies by age, medical condition, or treatment type
      - List any treatments or conditions exempt from co-payment
      - Detail any variant-specific differences in co-payment requirements
      - Note any conditions where co-payment may be waived

   g) DOMICILIARY/HOME HOSPITALIZATION

      - List specific conditions or treatments covered under domiciliary hospitalization
      - Identify all expenses specifically excluded from domiciliary coverage
      - Detail all conditions that must be satisfied for domiciliary coverage
      - Note any documentation requirements specific to domiciliary claims

   h) ROAD AMBULANCE
      - Document the coverage amount or limits for road ambulance services
      - Identify if coverage is per hospitalization, per policy year, or per insured
      - List all conditions under which ambulance services are covered
      - Detail any exclusions specific to ambulance coverage
      - Note any network restrictions for ambulance services

   i) AIR AMBULANCE
      - Document the coverage amount or limits for air ambulance services
      - Identify if coverage is per hospitalization, per policy year, or per insured
      - List all conditions under which air ambulance services are covered
      - Detail any geographical or situational restrictions for air ambulance coverage
      - Note any pre-authorization requirements for air ambulance services

   j) NON-MEDICAL/NON-PAYABLE ITEMS
      - Identify which typically non-payable items are covered in the policy
      - Document any limits or sub-limits for such items
      - List non-medical items that remain explicitly excluded
      - Detail any conditions for coverage of otherwise non-payable items
      - Note any variant-specific differences in coverage of non-medical items

2. ENSURE THOROUGHNESS in your analysis:
   - Look for explicit information as well as implied conditions
   - Pay attention to footnotes, appendices, or referenced documents
   - Identify any special cases or exceptions for each coverage feature
   - Note if any of these features vary by policy variant
   - Look for interconnections between different hospitalization coverage features

3. MAINTAIN ACCURACY:
   - Only include information explicitly stated in the document
   - Do not make assumptions or inferences unless clearly supported by the document
   - If information about any feature is missing, indicate this explicitly
   - Provide exact values, percentages, time periods, and limits as specified in the document

After completing your analysis, provide your findings in the following standardized JSON format ONLY:
