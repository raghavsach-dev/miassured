2. ENSURE THOROUGHNESS in your analysis:
   - Look for explicit information as well as implied conditions

   - Identify any special cases or exceptions
   - Note if any of these features vary by policy variant

3. MAINTAIN ACCURACY:
   - Only include information explicitly stated in the document
   - Do not make assumptions or inferences unless clearly supported by the document
   - If information about any feature is missing, indicate this explicitly
   - Provide exact values, ranges, and limits as specified in the document

After completing your analysis, provide your findings in the following standardized JSON format ONLY:
