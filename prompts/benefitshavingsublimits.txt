Now that you have thoroughly analyzed the insurance document, I need you to focus specifically on the BENEFITS HAVING SUB-LIMITS aspects of the insurance policy.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. IDENTIFY and ANALYZE ALL benefits mentioned in the policy document that have coverage sub-limits less than the Base Sum Insured. These could include:
   - Treatment-specific benefits with monetary caps
   - Procedure-specific benefits with coverage limits
   - Time-bound benefits with restricted coverage
   - Condition-specific benefits with capped amounts
   - Any other benefit where the maximum coverage is less than the full Sum Insured

2. For EACH benefit with sub-limits identified, extract and analyze the following information:

   a) BENEFIT IDENTIFICATION
      - Document the exact name of the benefit with sub-limit
      - Identify the section/page of the policy where this benefit is described
      - Note if this is a standard benefit or an optional/add-on benefit
      - Classify the benefit type (treatment coverage, hospitalization expense, etc.)

   b) BENEFIT OVERVIEW
      - Provide a comprehensive summary of what the benefit covers
      - Identify the core purpose of this benefit
      - Detail how this benefit fits into the overall policy coverage
      - Note any unique aspects or special considerations

   c) SUB-LIMIT DETAILS
      - Document the exact sub-limit amount or percentage of sum insured
      - Identify if the sub-limit is a fixed amount or varies by sum insured band
      - Detail if the sub-limit is per claim, per year, or per policy term
      - Note how the sub-limit compares to the full sum insured
      - Document if the sub-limit can be enhanced through any add-ons
      - List any variant-specific differences in sub-limits

   d) COVERAGE SPECIFICS
      - List all specific items, procedures, or conditions covered under this benefit
      - Identify any specific exclusions within this benefit
      - Detail any coverage limitations beyond the monetary sub-limit
      - Note any specific documentation requirements to avail this benefit
      - Document any coverage enhancements available for this benefit

   e) WAITING PERIODS
      - Document any waiting periods specific to this benefit
      - Identify if the waiting period differs from standard policy waiting periods
      - Detail any conditions for waiver of waiting period
      - Note if waiting periods vary based on conditions or severity
      - List any immediate coverage components without waiting periods

   f) CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS
      - List all conditions that must be satisfied to avail this benefit
      - Identify any restrictions on usage frequency
      - Detail any geographical limitations
      - Note any network hospital restrictions
      - Document any pre-authorization requirements
      - List any post-claim restrictions or implications

   g) BENEFIT TYPE
      - Clearly indicate if this is a Base/Default feature or Optional/Add-on
      - If optional, document any additional premium required
      - Detail any policyholder choices that affect this benefit
      - Note if this benefit is available across all policy variants

3. ENSURE THOROUGHNESS in your analysis:
   - Look for explicit information as well as implied conditions
   - Pay attention to footnotes, appendices, or referenced documents
   - Cross-reference information from different sections of the policy
   - Identify any interdependencies between different benefits with sub-limits
   - Note how these sub-limits affect overall policy value and coverage

4. MAINTAIN ACCURACY:
   - Only include information explicitly stated in the document
   - Do not make assumptions or inferences unless clearly supported by the document
   - If information about any benefit is missing, indicate this explicitly
   - Provide exact amounts, percentages, conditions, and limitations as specified
   - Distinguish between actual sub-limits and general coverage conditions

After completing your analysis, provide your findings in the following standardized JSON format ONLY:

Include multiple benefit objects in the array, one for each benefit with sub-limits found in the policy. If a field is not applicable or information is not found, use empty strings for text fields and empty arrays [] for lists. For object values, maintain the structure but use empty strings or empty arrays for their properties.

DO NOT include any text outside of this JSON structure. Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted.
