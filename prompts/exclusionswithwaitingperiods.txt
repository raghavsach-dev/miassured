Now that you have thoroughly analyzed the insurance document, I need you to focus specifically on the EXCLUSIONS WITH WAITING PERIODS aspects of the insurance policy.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract and analyze ALL information related to the following exclusions with waiting periods:

   a) STANDARD EXCLUSION - 30-DAYS INITIAL WAITING PERIOD (CODE-EXCL03)
      - Document the exact waiting period duration (number of days)
      - List all expenses/conditions explicitly excluded during this period
      - Identify any expenses/conditions that are NOT excluded during this period
      - Detail all conditions that must be satisfied for these exclusions to apply
      - Note any exceptions to this waiting period (e.g., accidents, specific conditions)
      - Document if this waiting period applies to renewals or only to first-time policies

   b) STANDARD EXCLUSION - PRE-EXISTING DISEASES (PED) WAITING PERIOD (CODE-EXCL01)
      - Document the exact waiting period duration for pre-existing diseases
      - Identify how the policy defines "pre-existing diseases"
      - List any specific pre-existing conditions with unique waiting periods
      - Detail any conditions for disclosure of pre-existing diseases
      - Note any variant-specific differences in PED waiting periods
      - Document any exceptions where PED waiting period may be reduced or waived

   c) STANDARD EXCLUSION - SPECIFIED DISEASES/PROCEDURES WAITING PERIOD (NON-PED) (CODE-EXCL02)
      - Document the exact waiting period duration for specified diseases/procedures
      - List all specific diseases and procedures subject to this waiting period
      - Identify any expenses related to these conditions that may still be covered
      - Detail all conditions that must be satisfied after the waiting period
      - Note any variant-specific differences in specified disease waiting periods
      - Document any exceptions where these waiting periods may be reduced or waived

   d) NON-STANDARD EXCLUSION - PERSONAL WAITING PERIOD
      - Document how personal waiting periods are determined and applied
      - Identify circumstances under which personal waiting periods are imposed
      - List any conditions that commonly receive personal waiting periods
      - Detail the process for determining the duration of personal waiting periods
      - Note any appeals or review processes for personal waiting periods
      - Document how personal waiting periods differ from standard waiting periods

   e) MATERNITY WAITING PERIOD
      - Document the exact waiting period duration for maternity benefits
      - Identify all expenses covered after the maternity waiting period
      - List any expenses that remain excluded even after the waiting period
      - Detail conditions that must be satisfied to access maternity benefits
      - Note any variant-specific differences in maternity waiting periods
      - Document if the waiting period applies to specific complications or all maternity-related expenses

2. ENSURE THOROUGHNESS in your analysis:
   - Look for explicit information as well as implied conditions
   - Pay attention to footnotes, appendices, or referenced documents
   - Identify any special cases or exceptions for each exclusion type
   - Note if any of these exclusions vary by policy variant or policyholder characteristics
   - Document any disclosure requirements related to these waiting periods

3. MAINTAIN ACCURACY:
   - Only include information explicitly stated in the document
   - Do not make assumptions or inferences unless clearly supported by the document
   - If information about any exclusion is missing, indicate this explicitly
   - Provide exact durations, conditions, and exemptions as specified in the document

After completing your analysis, provide your findings in the following standardized JSON format ONLY:
