Now that you have thoroughly analyzed the insurance document, I need you to focus specifically on the POLICYHOLDER OBLIGATIONS aspects of the insurance policy.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. IDENTIFY and ANALYZE ALL aspects of the policy where policyholders have obligations, responsibilities, or duties. These could include:
   - Disclosure requirements at the time of application
   - Premium payment obligations
   - Claim notification requirements
   - Medical examination requirements
   - Documentation submission timelines
   - Renewal obligations
   - Disclosure of changed circumstances
   - Cooperation during claim processing
   - Any other responsibilities placed on the policyholder

2. For EACH policyholder obligation identified, extract and analyze the following information:

   a) OBLIGATION IDENTIFICATION
      - Document the exact name or description of the obligation/responsibility
      - Identify the section/page of the policy where this obligation is described
      - Categorize the type of obligation (disclosure, payment, notification, etc.)
      - Note when in the policy lifecycle this obligation applies (application, during coverage, claim time, renewal)

   b) OBLIGATION OVERVIEW
      - Provide a comprehensive summary of the obligation
      - Identify the core purpose of this obligation
      - Detail why this obligation is important for the insurer
      - Note any unique aspects or special considerations related to this obligation

   c) OBLIGATION SPECIFICS
      - Document the exact requirements the policyholder must fulfill
      - Identify any timelines or deadlines associated with the obligation
      - Detail any specific formats, channels, or methods required
      - Note any variations in the obligation based on circumstances
      - List any exceptions where the obligation may be waived
      - Document any assistance the insurer provides in fulfilling the obligation

   d) CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE
      - Detail what happens if the policyholder fails to meet this obligation
      - Identify if non-compliance results in claim rejection
      - Document if non-compliance affects policy validity
      - Note if non-compliance impacts specific benefits only
      - List any penalties, surcharges, or financial consequences
      - Document any remedial actions available to the policyholder
      - Detail any grace periods or opportunities to correct the non-compliance

   e) MITIGATION FACTORS
      - List any factors that might mitigate consequences of non-compliance
      - Identify any discretionary powers the insurer has regarding enforcement
      - Detail any appeals process available to the policyholder
      - Note any circumstances where consequences might be reduced
      - Document any regulatory protections for policyholders

3. ENSURE THOROUGHNESS in your analysis:
   - Look for explicit obligations as well as implied duties
   - Pay attention to footnotes, appendices, or referenced documents
   - Cross-reference information from different sections of the policy
   - Identify any obligations that vary by policy variant or policyholder type
   - Note any interdependencies between different obligations

4. MAINTAIN ACCURACY:
   - Only include information explicitly stated in the document
   - Do not make assumptions or inferences unless clearly supported by the document
   - If information about any obligation is missing, indicate this explicitly
   - Provide exact timelines, requirements, and consequences as specified
   - Distinguish between hard requirements and recommendations

After completing your analysis, provide your findings in the following standardized JSON format ONLY:

      }
    }
  ],
  "general_duty_of_disclosure": "",
  "overarching_compliance_requirements": [],
  "variant_specific_obligations": {}
}

Include multiple obligation objects in the array, one for each policyholder obligation found in the policy. If a field is not applicable or information is not found, use empty strings for text fields and empty arrays [] for lists. For object values, maintain the structure but use empty strings or empty arrays for their properties.

DO NOT include any text outside of this JSON structure. Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted.
