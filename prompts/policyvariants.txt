Now that you have thoroughly analyzed the insurance document, I need you to focus specifically on the POLICY VARIANTS aspects of the insurance policy.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract and analyze ALL information related to the POLICY VARIANTS of the insurance policy:

   a) VARIANT IDENTIFICATION
      - Identify all named variants of the policy mentioned in the document
      - Document the exact names of each variant as specified in the policy
      - Note any categorization or grouping of variants if applicable

   b) VARIANT-SPECIFIC FEATURES
      - For each identified variant, list all features that vary compared to other variants
      - Identify which features are enhanced, reduced, or uniquely available in each variant
      - Document any differences in coverage amounts or limits specific to each variant

   c) FEATURE SCOPE ANALYSIS
      - For each variant-specific feature, detail the exact scope of coverage
      - Document the specific conditions, limitations, or exclusions that apply
      - Note any waiting periods or other time-based restrictions that vary by variant

   d) VARIANT COMPARISON
      - Compare all variants in terms of benefits, coverage, and limitations
      - Identify the unique selling propositions for each variant
      - Document any premium differences mentioned across variants

   e) VARIANT ELIGIBILITY
      - Extract any eligibility criteria specific to certain variants
      - Document if certain variants are targeted at specific demographics
      - Note any restrictions on who can purchase each variant

   f) VARIANT UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES
      - Identify if and when policyholders can switch between variants
      - Document any conditions or limitations for upgrading/downgrading between variants
      - Note any waiting periods or other implications when changing variants

   g) BUNDLED BENEFITS
      - Identify any default add-ons or bundled benefits specific to certain variants
      - Document any optional add-ons available only to specific variants
      - Note how these bundled benefits affect the overall coverage or premium

2. ENSURE THOROUGHNESS in your analysis:
   - Look for explicit information as well as implied variations between variants
   - Pay attention to footnotes, appendices, or referenced documents
   - Identify any variant-specific terms and conditions
   - Note if certain variants have unique documentation requirements

3. MAINTAIN ACCURACY:
   - Only include information explicitly stated in the document
   - Do not make assumptions or inferences unless clearly supported by the document
   - If information about any variant or feature is missing, indicate this explicitly
   - Provide exact values, ranges, and limits as specified in the document for each variant

After completing your analysis, provide your findings in the following standardized JSON format ONLY:

  "policy_variants": {
    "variant_list": [],
    "variant_details": [
      {
        "variant_name": "",

  }
}

Fill all fields with information from the document. Include multiple variant detail objects in the "variant_details" array, one for each variant found in the policy. If a field is not applicable or information is not found, use empty strings for text fields and empty arrays [] for lists. For object values, maintain the structure but use empty strings or empty arrays for their properties.

DO NOT include any text outside of this JSON structure. Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted.
