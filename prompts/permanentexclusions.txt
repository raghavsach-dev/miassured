Now that you have thoroughly analyzed the insurance document, I need you to focus specifically on the PERMANENT EXCLUSIONS aspects of the insurance policy.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract and analyze ALL information related to the following permanent exclusions:

   a) STANDARD PERMANENT EXCLUSIONS (CODES-EXCL04 TO EXCL018)
      - Identify all standard exclusions mentioned in the policy (Codes Excl04 to Excl018)
      - Document the exact wording of each standard exclusion
      - List any clarifications or specific interpretations of these standard exclusions
      - Detail any exceptions to these standard exclusions
      - Note if any standard exclusions have been modified from their regulatory default wording
      - Document any conditions under which these exclusions might be partially waived

   b) PERMANENT EXCLUSIONS OF PRE-EXISTING DISEASES
      - List all pre-existing diseases (PEDs) that are permanently excluded
      - Identify how these permanent PED exclusions differ from PEDs with waiting periods
      - Document any conditions under which a PED might be reclassified as permanently excluded
      - Note any disclosure requirements specific to permanently excluded PEDs
      - Detail any appeals process for challenging permanent PED exclusions
      - Document any variant-specific differences in permanent PED exclusions

   c) NON-STANDARD PERMANENT EXCLUSIONS
      - List all insurer-specific permanent exclusions not covered under standard codes
      - Document the exact wording and scope of each non-standard exclusion
      - Identify any procedures, treatments, or charges specifically called out
      - Detail any conditions or circumstances that activate these exclusions
      - Note any documentation requirements related to these exclusions
      - Document any impact of these exclusions on overall policy benefits

2. ENSURE THOROUGHNESS in your analysis:
   - Look for explicit exclusions as well as implied exclusions within policy language
   - Pay attention to footnotes, appendices, or referenced documents that expand on exclusions
   - Identify any special cases or conditions for each exclusion type
   - Note if any exclusions vary by policy variant, policyholder characteristics, or geographic location
   - Document the relationship between different types of exclusions

3. CATEGORIZE exclusions by the following types where applicable:
   - Treatment-specific exclusions (e.g., cosmetic surgery, experimental treatments)
   - Condition-specific exclusions (e.g., congenital disorders, specific diseases)
   - Behavior-related exclusions (e.g., self-inflicted injuries, substance abuse)
   - Time-bound permanent exclusions (exclusions applied to specific time periods)
   - Facility or provider-specific exclusions
   - Geography-based exclusions

4. MAINTAIN ACCURACY:
   - Only include information explicitly stated in the document
   - Do not make assumptions or inferences unless clearly supported by the document
   - If information about any exclusion is missing, indicate this explicitly
   - Provide exact wording and scope as specified in the document
   - Note any ambiguities in the exclusion language

After completing your analysis, provide your findings in the following standardized JSON format ONLY. Ensure all string values are properly escaped, especially for newlines and quotes:

    }
  }
}

Fill all fields with information from the document. If a field is not applicable or information is not found, use empty strings for text fields and empty arrays [] for lists. For object values, maintain the structure but use empty strings or empty arrays for their properties.

DO NOT include any text outside of this JSON structure. Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted. Avoid using newlines within string values - instead use spaces or semicolons to separate items.
