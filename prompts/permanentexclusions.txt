Now that you have thoroughly analyzed the insurance document, I need you to focus specifically on the PERMANENT EXCLUSIONS aspects of the insurance policy.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract and analyze ALL information related to the following permanent exclusions:

   a) STANDARD PERMANENT EXCLUSIONS (CODES-EXCL04 TO EXCL018)
      - Identify all standard exclusions mentioned in the policy (Codes Excl04 to Excl018)
      - Document the exact wording of each standard exclusion
      - List any clarifications or specific interpretations of these standard exclusions
      - Detail any exceptions to these standard exclusions
      - Note if any standard exclusions have been modified from their regulatory default wording
      - Document any conditions under which these exclusions might be partially waived

   b) PERMANENT EXCLUSIONS OF PRE-EXISTING DISEASES
      - List all pre-existing diseases (PEDs) that are permanently excluded
      - Identify how these permanent PED exclusions differ from PEDs with waiting periods
      - Document any conditions under which a PED might be reclassified as permanently excluded
      - Note any disclosure requirements specific to permanently excluded PEDs
      - Detail any appeals process for challenging permanent PED exclusions
      - Document any variant-specific differences in permanent PED exclusions

   c) NON-STANDARD PERMANENT EXCLUSIONS
      - List all insurer-specific permanent exclusions not covered under standard codes
      - Document the exact wording and scope of each non-standard exclusion
      - Identify any procedures, treatments, or charges specifically called out
      - Detail any conditions or circumstances that activate these exclusions
      - Note any documentation requirements related to these exclusions
      - Document any impact of these exclusions on overall policy benefits

2. ENSURE THOROUGHNESS in your analysis:
   - Look for explicit exclusions as well as implied exclusions within policy language
   - Pay attention to footnotes, appendices, or referenced documents that expand on exclusions
   - Identify any special cases or conditions for each exclusion type
   - Note if any exclusions vary by policy variant, policyholder characteristics, or geographic location
   - Document the relationship between different types of exclusions

3. CATEGORIZE exclusions by the following types where applicable:
   - Treatment-specific exclusions (e.g., cosmetic surgery, experimental treatments)
   - Condition-specific exclusions (e.g., congenital disorders, specific diseases)
   - Behavior-related exclusions (e.g., self-inflicted injuries, substance abuse)
   - Time-bound permanent exclusions (exclusions applied to specific time periods)
   - Facility or provider-specific exclusions
   - Geography-based exclusions

4. MAINTAIN ACCURACY:
   - Only include information explicitly stated in the document
   - Do not make assumptions or inferences unless clearly supported by the document
   - If information about any exclusion is missing, indicate this explicitly
   - Provide exact wording and scope as specified in the document
   - Note any ambiguities in the exclusion language

After completing your analysis, provide your findings in the following standardized JSON format ONLY:
