Now that you have thoroughly analyzed the insurance document, I need you to focus specifically on the OPTIONAL or ADD-ON BENEFITS aspects of the insurance policy.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. IDENTIFY and ANALYZE ALL optional, add-on, or rider benefits mentioned in the policy document. These are benefits that:
   - Require the customer's explicit opt-in
   - May require additional premium
   - Are not part of the standard/base/default coverage

2. For EACH optional or add-on benefit identified, extract and analyze the following information:

   a) BENEFIT IDENTIFICATION
      - Document the exact name of the optional benefit/add-on/rider
      - Identify if it's categorized as a rider, add-on, or optional cover
      - Note any marketing names or branding associated with the benefit
      - Document the section/page of the policy where this benefit is described

   b) BENEFIT OVERVIEW
      - Provide a comprehensive summary of what the benefit covers
      - Identify the core purpose of this add-on benefit
      - Detail how this benefit extends or enhances the base policy coverage
      - Note any unique selling points or differentiators of this benefit

   c) COVERAGE DETAILS
      - Document the exact coverage amount or limit
      - Identify if the coverage is a fixed amount or percentage of sum insured
      - Detail any sub-limits within the benefit
      - Note if the benefit has any aggregate annual limits
      - List all specific items, conditions, or situations covered
      - Document any coverage enhancements over standard policy terms

   d) WAITING PERIODS
      - Document any waiting periods specific to this optional benefit
      - Identify if the waiting period differs from standard policy waiting periods
      - Detail any conditions for waiver of waiting period
      - Note if waiting periods vary based on conditions or treatments
      - List any immediate coverage components without waiting periods

   e) EXCLUSIONS AND RESTRICTIONS
      - List all specific exclusions applicable to this optional benefit
      - Identify any conditions or restrictions for availing the benefit
      - Detail any geographical limitations
      - Note any time-based restrictions
      - Document any usage frequency limitations
      - List any pre-authorization requirements specific to this benefit

   f) PREMIUM IMPACT
      - Document the exact additional premium required (amount or percentage)
      - Identify if the premium varies by age, sum insured, or other factors
      - Detail any discounts available on this optional benefit
      - Note how selecting this benefit impacts overall policy premium
      - Document if premium for this benefit is fixed or variable over policy term

   g) CLAIM PROCESS
      - Detail any specific claim process for this optional benefit
      - Identify any additional documentation required
      - Note any special settlement procedures
      - Document any third-party administrators involved
      - List any claim intimation timeframes specific to this benefit

3. ENSURE THOROUGHNESS in your analysis:
   - Look for explicit information as well as implied conditions
   - Pay attention to footnotes, appendices, or referenced documents
   - Cross-reference information from different sections of the policy
   - Identify any interdependencies between different optional benefits
   - Note any optional benefits that cannot be combined with others

4. MAINTAIN ACCURACY:
   - Only include information explicitly stated in the document
   - Do not make assumptions or inferences unless clearly supported by the document
   - If information about any benefit is missing, indicate this explicitly
   - Provide exact amounts, percentages, conditions, and limitations as specified
   - Distinguish between optional benefits and standard/default coverages

After completing your analysis, provide your findings in the following standardized JSON format ONLY. Ensure all string values are properly escaped, especially for newlines and quotes:

Include multiple benefit objects in the array, one for each optional or add-on benefit found in the policy. If a field is not applicable or information is not found, use empty strings for text fields and empty arrays [] for lists. For object values, maintain the structure but use empty strings or empty arrays for their properties.

DO NOT include any text outside of this JSON structure. Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted. Avoid using newlines within string values - instead use spaces or semicolons to separate items.
