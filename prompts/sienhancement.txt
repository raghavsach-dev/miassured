Now that you have thoroughly analyzed the insurance document, I need you to focus specifically on the SUM INSURED (SI) ENHANCEMENT aspects of the insurance policy.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract and analyze ALL information related to the following SI Enhancement features:

   a) RESTORE/RESET SUM INSURED
      - Document the exact mechanism of sum insured restoration (complete/partial)
      - Identify the trigger conditions for restoration (e.g., after complete exhaustion)
      - Detail any limitations on what the restored sum insured can be used for
      - Note any caps or limits on the restoration amount
      - List the number of times restoration can be availed in a policy year
      - Document if restoration applies to individual members or the entire family in family floater policies
      - Identify if restoration requires additional premium or is a default feature
      - Detail any waiting periods after restoration before the restored amount can be used
      - List any diseases/conditions explicitly excluded from restoration coverage

   b) NO CLAIM BONUS
      - Document the exact percentage or amount of No Claim Bonus (NCB)
      - Identify if NCB accumulates as additional sum insured or discount on premium
      - Detail the maximum limit up to which NCB can accumulate
      - Note how NCB is affected by partial claims or small claims
      - List any conditions under which NCB might be reduced or reset to zero
      - Document if NCB applies to individual members or the entire family in family floater policies
      - Identify any variant-specific differences in NCB structure
      - Detail if NCB is applied at renewal or during the policy term
      - List any diseases/conditions explicitly excluded from NCB earned sum insured

   c) UTILIZATION SEQUENCE OF ENHANCED SUM INSURED
      - Document the exact sequence in which different sum insured components are utilized
      - Identify which component is used first (base SI, NCB, restoration, etc.)
      - Detail any customer choice available in the utilization sequence
      - Note any disease-specific or treatment-specific utilization sequences
      - List any component-specific restrictions in the utilization sequence
      - Document how the utilization sequence affects future benefits or restorations
      - Identify if the utilization sequence varies by claim type or size
      - Detail how deductibles or co-payments apply in the utilization sequence

2. ENSURE THOROUGHNESS in your analysis:
   - Look for explicit information as well as implied conditions
   - Pay attention to footnotes, appendices, or referenced documents
   - Identify any special cases or exceptions for each enhancement feature
   - Note if any of these features vary by policy variant or sum insured band
   - Document the interdependencies between different SI enhancement features

3. MAINTAIN ACCURACY:
   - Only include information explicitly stated in the document
   - Do not make assumptions or inferences unless clearly supported by the document
   - If information about any feature is missing, indicate this explicitly
   - Provide exact values, percentages, conditions, and limitations as specified in the document

After completing your analysis, provide your findings in the following standardized JSON format ONLY:

Fill all fields with information from the document. If a field is not applicable or information is not found, use empty strings for text fields and empty arrays [] for lists. For object values, maintain the structure but use empty strings or empty arrays for their properties.

DO NOT include any text outside of this JSON structure. Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted.
